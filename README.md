sparetheair
===========

A tool to publish SF Bay Area Spare The Air data as an ical

So far, it will return the status of spare the air for today:
```
$ ./sparetheair.py
On 2013-12-23, a spare the air day is in effect: True
```

...but eventually, I would like it to scrape data daily and publish an ical.
